# The Last High-Level Language

A dystopian twist on the classic Hangman game where the stakes are humanity's programming future. With each failed guess, another programming language is eliminated from existence. Fail to guess the word in time, and the world will be forever doomed to program only in Assembly.

Project from [Scrimba Learn React Cource](https://scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e)

- üéØ 8 attempts to save the programming world
- üíª Programming-themed word bank
- üåç Progressive language elimination system
- üéÆ Interactive keyboard interface
- üì± Responsive design for all devices

## Technologies Used

- React
- npm
- node
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

cd The-Last-High-Level-Language-Learning-React
```

2. Install dependencies:

## Customization

### Adding New Words

Modify the `WORDS` array in the main component:

```javascript
const WORDS = [
  "PROGRAMMING",
  "JAVASCRIPT",
  // Add more words here
];
```

### Modifying Language Elimination Sequence

Update the `LANGUAGE_ELIMINATIONS` array to change the order or add new languages:

```javascript
const LANGUAGE_ELIMINATIONS = [
  {
    attempts: 7,
    message: "‚ö†Ô∏è [Language] has been eliminated...",
    language: "[Language]",
  },
  // Add more eliminations
];
